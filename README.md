# Alfred-workflow-get-weekday-of-date
An Alfred workflow to get the name of the weekday for a given date
This basic little workflow simply returns the name of the weekday for any given date. However, please note:
- It requires Alfred 5.
- The given date must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy (e.g., 28/08/2022).
- The workflow uses AppleScript at its core.
- There is *some* validation of user input but I have no doubt the poor thing will break if you kick it hard enough. 😁
- When you have installed it `Configure workflow` explains its pretty basic use.

**Important note**
For this workflow to work properly your date settings in System Preferences (macOS pre-Ventura) *must* show the date format mentioned (i.e., dd/mm/yyyy) for `System Preferences > Language & Region > Advanced > Dates` `Short:`.

**Warning: the most recent version is for testing only!**
